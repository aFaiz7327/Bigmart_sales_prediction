üìå Problem Understanding
The BigMart sales prediction challenge required forecasting product sales across various outlets using features like product type, weight, visibility, and outlet characteristics. The key business goal was to understand the factors influencing sales and build an accurate prediction model.

üîç My Approach
1. üß† Data Exploration & Understanding
Explored data to understand structure and detect patterns/anomalies:

Missing values in Item_Weight (~17.2%) and Outlet_Size (~28.3%)

Inconsistent labeling in Item_Fat_Content categories

Suspicious zero values in Item_Visibility (~8.2% of records)

Strong correlation between Item_MRP and Item_Outlet_Sales (~0.57)

Noticed significant sales differences across outlet types and establishment years

2. üß∞ Feature Engineering Strategy
‚û§ Missing Value Treatment
Item_Weight: Imputed using a multi-tiered strategy (by product, type mean, and overall mean)

Outlet_Size: Filled using contextual information (outlet type & location patterns)

‚û§ Data Cleaning
Standardized inconsistent entries in Item_Fat_Content

Replaced zero visibility values with mean visibility per item type

‚û§ Core Feature Creation
Outlet_Years and age categories to model establishment effect

Item_Category extracted from Item_Identifier

Price_per_Weight ratio created to reflect value perception

Visibility flags and adjusted values for zero entries

‚û§ Regenerated Features
Market Positioning: Categorized items as Premium, Budget, or Standard based on price & fat content

Interaction Features: Outlet_Item_Combo and other combinations to capture specific outlet-item dynamics

Store Performance Metrics: Aggregated outlet-level sales stats from training data

‚û§ Feature Binning
Created bins for Item_MRP, Item_Weight, etc., to capture non-linear trends

3. ü§ñ Modeling Strategy
Model Diversity: Trained 15 regression models including:

Tree-based: XGBoost, Random Forest

Boosting: Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost

Linear: Ridge, Lasso, etc.

Robust Evaluation:

Cross-validation using RMSE

Ensured generalization and prevented overfitting

Hyperparameter Tuning:

Used RandomizedSearchCV for efficiency and performance

Weighted Ensemble:

Final prediction is a blend of top 2 models with a 70%-30% weighting to reduce variance and increase accuracy

4. üìä Results and Insights
‚úÖ Feature Importance
Top predictors: Item_MRP, Outlet_Type, and interaction features

‚úÖ Model Performance
Weighted ensemble outperformed individual models

XGBoost and Gradient Boosting ranked among top performers

‚úÖ Business Insights
Premium items in Supermarket Type3 had highest sales

Outlets opened post-2000 generally underperformed compared to older ones

Higher visibility correlated with better sales

Certain item-outlet pairs were consistently top-performing

5. üöÄ Final Implementation
The final solution:

Uses a 70%-30% weighted ensemble of the two best models (typically XGBoost and Gradient Boosting)

Balances strength and generalization of different algorithms

Produces stable, high-accuracy forecasts

Provides interpretable and actionable business insights

This end-to-end solution integrates in-depth feature engineering and a robust ensemble model to not only deliver high prediction accuracy but also help BigMart gain clarity on what drives their sales.
